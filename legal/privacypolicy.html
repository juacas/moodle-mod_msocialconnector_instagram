<p class="title">Msocial-instagram for Instagram’s Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Msocial-instagram is a plugin for Moodle providing registered users of Instagram to use the posts and interactions in classroom and educational activities (“Services”).</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how and when Msocial-instagram collects, uses and shares your information when you use our Services. 
Msocial-instagram receives your information only through Instagram APIs.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:jpdecastro@tel.uva.es">jpdecastro@tel.uva.es</a>.</p>

<p class="title">Information Collection and Use</p>
<p>We collect and use your information below to provide our Services and to measure and improve our Services from time to time.</p> 
<p><span class="title">Information Sharing and Disclosure</span><br>
We do not disclose your private personal information. All the records are held in your University database and used only to give the Services.</p>

<p><span class="title">Law and Harm</span>: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably 
necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Msocial-instagram's rights or property.
 However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party, including a government, request to disclose your information.</p>

<p><span class="title">Non-Private or Non-Personal Information</span>: We won't share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information,
such as your public user profile information, the people you share your information with, or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did),
except to your teachers in the context of the MSocial activity.</p>

<p><span class="title">Changes to this Policy</span><br>
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at
http://yourelearningserver/<a href="mod/msocial/connector/instagram/legal/privacypolicy.html">mod/msocial/connector/instagram/legal/privacypolicy.html</a>. 
If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, 
we will update that document.
By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
